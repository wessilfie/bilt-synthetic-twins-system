      <p class="section-label">Context</p>
      <h2 class="section-title reveal">The Night Bilt 2.0 Launched</h2>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>In January 2026, I was invited to Bilt's 2.0 launch event. It was a great event with Bilt employees, special guests, and Bilt members. Ankur Jain took the stage and unveiled the new cards. Three tiers. New currency. A complete reimagining of the product.</p>
        <p>I'd been a Bilt 1.0 cardholder for years. I liked the card. The promise was simple and it worked: earn points on rent, for free. That simplicity is what made it easy to recommend to every renter I knew.</p>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>But something felt off that night. Even in a room full of Bilt's closest friends and partners, I could hear the murmuring. People turning to each other after the presentation, eyebrows raised, doing the math out loud. "Wait, there's a fee on rent now?" "Why would I pay $495 for this?" The new cards looked beautiful. The value proposition did not.</p>
        <p>I left that event unsure what to think. I'd told many of my friends to get a Bilt card. Now I wasn't sure it made sense to get a 2.0 card myself.</p>
        <p>The next day I went online and saw how negatively people had reacted. The r/biltrewards subreddit had gone from jovial to irate. Even as Bilt announced changes to walk back some of the most controversial decisions, I could see they'd lost a lot of goodwill. The community became less forgiving of mistakes, reticent to move their spend to these new cards. And the math told the real story: Bilt kept saying "free points on rent," but their new 4% Bilt Cash earn rate on spend meant that to unlock enough Bilt Cash to offset the rent fee, you'd effectively need to spend roughly 75% of your rent or mortgage cost on a Bilt card. That's not free. That's a loyalty tax disguised as a rewards program.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <h3>What Bilt 2.0 actually changed</h3>
        <p>Bilt's 1.0 card had a simple setup. Earn points for paying rent as long as you made 5 transactions on the card each month. A common joke in their Reddit community was members buying 5 bananas each month to unlock those points. This proposition was unparalleled, giving people points on one of the biggest areas people spend on each month.</p>
        <p>Bilt 2.0 replaced that single no-fee card with a three-tier system: <strong>Blue ($0)</strong>, <strong>Obsidian ($95)</strong>, and <strong>Palladium ($495)</strong>. They introduced "Bilt Cash," a new currency that required everyday spending to unlock housing rewards. And the 3% rent processing fee? That was the match that lit the fire.</p>

  <!-- ===== SECTION 3: THE QUESTION ===== -->

    <div class="container">
      <p class="section-label">The Question</p>
      <h2 class="section-title reveal">Could this have been predicted<br>before launch?</h2>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>That question stuck with me after the launch event. Not just "could Bilt have seen this coming," but something bigger: can companies use <strong>AI and public community data</strong> to test how their most vocal customers will react before they ship? Not after the CEO apology. Before the product leaves the building.</p>
        <p>For my GenAI Meets Marketing Data class at Columbia Business School, I decided to find out. An important framing note: Reddit users are not representative of all customers. They skew toward enthusiasts, power users, and people with strong opinions. But that's exactly the population whose reaction can make or break a launch. If you can predict how Reddit reacts, you're predicting the first wave of public sentiment that shapes media coverage, social proof, and word of mouth. This project tests two hypotheses:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hypothesis-cards reveal">
        <div class="glass-card">
          <span class="card-number">Hypothesis 1</span>
          <p>Large language models (like Claude and ChatGPT) combined with public Reddit data can create synthetic personas that <strong>represent how online communities</strong> think about and use these products.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card">
          <span class="card-number">Hypothesis 2</span>
          <p>Those personas can <strong>predict community reactions</strong> to product launches more cheaply and faster than traditional user research.</p>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>Here's the core idea. Take thousands of real Reddit posts from credit card communities. Feed them to an AI. Ask it to build detailed customer personas grounded in how real people actually talk about these products: their frustrations, their spending habits, their deal-breakers.</p>
        <p>Then interview those personas. Present them with a product scenario they've never seen before and ask: how would you react?</p>
        <p>Think of it as a simulated focus group. Thirty distinct individuals, each with a coherent backstory, financial situation, and set of values drawn from real community data. Not generic chatbot outputs. Actual synthetic people with opinions.</p>

        <p>I built 60 user personas, 30 per each year of data (2024 and 2025), to understand how these personas and what mattered to them changed over time. Rather than focusing solely on r/biltrewards, I manually pulled in similar subreddits to broaden the analysis across four different Reddit communities: <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/biltrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/biltrewards</a></strong> (Bilt users), <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/amex</a></strong> (American Express users), <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmexPlatinum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/amexplatinum</a></strong> (Amex Platinum users), and <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Venturex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/Venturex</a></strong> (Capital One Venture X users). This gave diversity of thought, community size, and user backgrounds. Each persona is rooted in real posts, real frustrations, and real product relationships.</p>

      <p class="section-label">The Setup</p>
      <h2 class="section-title reveal">Rumors: Two Launches Approaching</h2>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>In late 2025, both Bilt and Amex were rumored to be refreshing their flagship cards. Reddit was buzzing. Leaked survey screenshots, speculation threads, anxiety about upcoming changes. I collected this pre-launch data and built the synthetic personas from it.</p>
        <p>Then I presented each persona with the actual product scenarios and asked them to react. The interview had two rounds:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hypothesis-cards reveal">
        <div class="glass-card">
          <span class="card-number">Round 1: Individual Reaction</span>
          <p>Each persona sees the product announcement for the first time and reacts based solely on their own values, financial situation, and card relationships. No outside influence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card">
          <span class="card-number">Round 2: Social Influence</span>
          <p>The same personas are shown real Reddit posts discussing each product. Then they answer the same questions again. This measures how community conversation shifts individual opinion.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3 class="subsection-title reveal">What the personas reacted to</h3>
      <p class="content-block reveal">Each persona received a detailed product scenario describing the rumored changes. Here are the two scenarios presented:</p>

      <div class="scenario-cards reveal">
        <div class="scenario-card">
          <h4>Bilt 2.0 Scenario</h4>
          <ul class="scenario-changes">
            <li>Single card replaced by three tiers: Blue ($0), Obsidian ($95), Palladium ($495)</li>
            <li>New "Bilt Cash" currency for everyday spending</li>
            <li>3% processing fee on rent payments</li>
            <li>Migration from Wells Fargo to Cardless platform</li>
            <li>Dining partnerships and neighborhood rewards restructured</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="scenario-fee">3% rent fee</div>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario-card">
          <h4>Amex Platinum Refresh Scenario</h4>
          <ul class="scenario-changes">
            <li>Annual fee increases from $695 to $895</li>
            <li>$600 hotel credit (tripled from $200)</li>
            <li>$400 Resy dining credit (new)</li>
            <li>$120 Uber One credit, $300 digital entertainment credit</li>
            <li>New Lululemon, Oura Ring partnerships</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="scenario-fee">$895/yr</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>With the synthetic twins, I wanted to understand how would they react to hearing about both of these cards. Both involved changes in terms of features or fee, but would the personas have the same reaction?</p>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>The biggest risk with LLM-based prediction is <strong>regurgitation</strong>: since these models are trained on internet data, we need to ensure they're genuinely simulating reactions rather than recalling outcomes already in their training data. The evaluation approach was defined upfront, before running any personas through the scenarios: compare predicted sentiment scores against actual public reception, using the Amex refresh as a control case. Here's how the experiment was controlled.</p>

        <div class="checklist-item">
          <div class="check-icon">&#10003;</div>

          <div class="check-icon">&#10003;</div>
          <div><h4>Cross-tool validation</h4><p>The identical pipeline was also run through <strong>OpenAI GPT-5.2-Codex Low</strong> to test whether results depend on the specific AI tool used.</p></div>

Amex <strong>added tangible value</strong> alongside the price increase: a $400 dining credit, a $600 hotel credit, and new partnerships with Lululemon and Oura Ring. No core benefit was removed. Amex gave customers new reasons to stay. Bilt took away the one reason they signed up.</p>

        <h3>The 1.2-point gap told the whole story</h3>
        <p><strong>Bilt at 2.07/5:</strong> "Needs fundamental product changes before launch."</p>
        <p><strong>Amex at 3.27/5:</strong> "Core product is sound. Focus messaging on price-sensitive segments."</p>
        <p>A system that simply said "customers won't like changes" would be useless. The value is in the <strong>relative signal</strong>: the framework correctly differentiated a launch that would fail from one that would survive, and identified exactly why.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <h3>But the AI wasn't perfect</h3>
        <p>The synthetic twins predicted <strong>0% interest in paid tiers</strong> and suggested the majority of users would leave Bilt entirely. That turned out to be overstated. Two weeks after launch, Ankur Jain emailed members noting that <strong>83% of active cardholders had requested a Bilt 2.0 card</strong> and that new applicant volume was running 1.5x higher than the Bilt 1.0 peak.</p>
        <p>The AI was directionally right: the backlash was real, the messaging was a disaster, and the CEO had to publicly apologize. But it overstated how many users would actually walk away. In reality, most people still wanted the card. They just wanted it communicated differently. Inertia, switching costs, and the underlying product value kept users on board even when sentiment was deeply negative.</p>
        <p>This is an important calibration point: <strong>synthetic twins predict sentiment, not behavior</strong>. People can be furious about a product change and still use the product. The framework tells you how customers will feel about your launch, not whether they'll literally cancel. That's still enormously valuable (it correctly identified the crisis), but it should not be mistaken for a churn model.</p>

  <!-- ===== SECTION 10: COULD BILT HAVE SAVED IT? ===== -->
  <section id="rework" class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <p class="section-label">The Counterfactual</p>
      <h2 class="section-title reveal">Could Bilt Have Saved It<br>With Better Messaging?</h2>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>The synthetic twins told us Bilt 2.0 would fail. But here's a harder question: <strong>could the same product have landed differently?</strong></p>
        <p>Bilt couldn't just go back to the old card. The economics had changed. They needed tiers, they needed a revenue model beyond interchange, and they needed to migrate platforms. Those were business realities, not messaging choices. But how you frame a change matters enormously, and Bilt's framing made every change feel like a loss.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <h3>What Bilt got wrong wasn't the product. It was the framing.</h3>
        <p>Consider the difference between these two framings of the exact same change:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="scenario-cards reveal">
        <div class="scenario-card" style="border-color: rgba(239,68,68,0.3);">
          <h4 style="color: var(--accent-red);">How Bilt framed it</h4>
          <ul class="scenario-changes">
            <li>3% processing fee on rent payments</li>
            <li>New Bilt Cash currency replaces direct point earning</li>
            <li>Three tiers: Blue, Obsidian ($95), Palladium ($495)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="scenario-card" style="border-color: rgba(34,197,94,0.3);">
          <h4 style="color: var(--accent-green);">How it could have been framed</h4>
          <ol class="scenario-changes">
            <li>This is now a card you want to use for everything, not just rent</li>
            <li>Still the only card on the market that makes it easy to earn points on rent without the higher fees other options charge</li>
            <li>Still no annual fee. Still earn on rent. Now also earn 4% Bilt Cash on everyday spend</li>
            <li>One free card with everything you have today, plus optional premium tiers for power users</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <h3>Why the Amex playbook worked</h3>
        <p>Amex raised the Platinum annual fee by <strong>$200</strong> and the community's average reaction was 1.2 points higher than Bilt's. Why? Because Amex led with what they were <strong>adding</strong>: a tripled hotel credit, a new $400 dining credit, Lululemon and Oura Ring partnerships. The fee increase was presented as the cost of getting more, not the cost of keeping what you already had.</p>
        <p>Bilt did the opposite. Every headline was about what was being <strong>taken away</strong>: free rent points now had conditions, the simple card was replaced by confusing tiers, and a startup was handling your credit history. The product changes may have been defensible. The communication strategy was not.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal callout-box">
        <h3>The lesson for product teams</h3>
        <p>Synthetic twins don't just predict whether a launch will fail. They can be used to <strong>test alternative messaging</strong> before committing to one. Run the same product through three different framings. See which one the personas react to least negatively. Iterate on the message, not just the product.</p>
        <p>A company with this framework could have tested Bilt's announcement copy against an Amex-style "here's what you're gaining" approach and discovered the gap before a single customer saw it. <strong>The $75 it costs to run this test is cheaper than a CEO apology email.</strong></p>

        <h3>Speed creates room to iterate</h3>
        <p>The real advantage isn't just that synthetic twins are faster. It's what that speed enables. When insights arrive in hours instead of weeks, product teams can test multiple messaging variants, pricing structures, and feature combinations <strong>before committing to anything</strong>. You learn what resonates early enough to actually change course.</p>
        <p>Bilt's team shipped a single version of the announcement and found out it was wrong from actual customers. With synthetic twins, they could have tested three framings in a single afternoon and discovered that leading with "what you're losing" was the wrong approach before a single real customer saw it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <h3>Why companies should build this in-house</h3>
        <p>Companies already have proprietary data (spending patterns, support tickets, NPS scores) that would make these personas significantly more accurate than a Reddit-only approach. The tooling is commoditized: an AI coding assistant, public Reddit archives, and a Python script. No proprietary infrastructure required.</p>
        <p>More importantly, iteration requires domain knowledge. The most valuable part of this project was catching errors and making judgment calls that an outside vendor would miss.</p>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>I didn't want this project to be a one-tool story. So I ran the identical pipeline through both <strong>Claude Code (powered by Opus 4.5)</strong> and <strong>OpenAI GPT-5.2-Codex Low</strong>. Same data, same spec, same prompts. The quality gap surprised me.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="comparison-table reveal">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th></th><th>GPT-5.2-Codex Low</th><th>Claude Code / Opus 4.5</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Persona names</td><td class="cell-bad">Same 10 names recycled across every card and year</td><td class="cell-good">Unique, culturally diverse names per set</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Writing style</td><td class="cell-bad">Keyword tags and bullet points, analytical but formulaic</td><td class="cell-good">Full narrative prose, distinct voice per persona</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Field variation</td><td class="cell-bad">~70% of fields copy-pasted across all personas</td><td class="cell-good">100% of fields custom-written per persona</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Card specificity</td><td class="cell-bad">Generic template applied to all cards (e.g. "lounge access" listed for Bilt)</td><td class="cell-good">Product-specific details (rent day bonuses, Schwab cash-out, transfer partners)</td></tr>

          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>Codex produced structurally complete outputs and got straight to the point. Its personas were analytical and direct, which makes sense given how that model is trained. But the analysis was formulaic: the same 10 gender-neutral names recycled across every card product and year, most fields filled with identical keyword tags regardless of the persona, and a generic template that listed "lounge access" as a benefit for Bilt cardholders (Bilt has no lounge benefit). Claude Code's personas, by contrast, were more imaginative. Each one read like a distinct person with a unique voice, specific product knowledge, and internally consistent financial behaviors. That richness is what made it possible to identify which customer segments were most at risk and surface concerns the product team had not anticipated.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <h3>What building with Claude Code actually looked like</h3>
        <p>I want to be honest about this: the AI did not just work out of the box. This project required constant human-in-the-loop oversight. The AI did the heavy lifting on data processing and persona generation, but every step needed my judgment:</p>

        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">1</span>
          <h4>Catching hallucinated product details</h4>
          <p>The AI confidently stated Amex points transfer to United MileagePlus. They don't; that's a Chase partner. Persona behaviors and attitudes were well-grounded, but specific product features required fact-checking.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">2</span>
          <h4>Forcing demographic diversity</h4>
          <p>Left to its own defaults, the AI gave every persona an "Excellent 750+" credit score. Real users range from building credit for the first time to carrying balances. Manual intervention was required to create realistic distributions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">3</span>
          <h4>Managing temporal data contamination</h4>
          <p>The AI treated post-launch reactions as if they were pre-launch sentiment. Strict date filters had to be enforced manually to prevent the model from "knowing" outcomes it shouldn't have access to.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">4</span>
          <h4>Correcting primary card assumptions</h4>
          <p>The AI assumed every r/biltrewards user had Bilt as their primary card. In reality, Bilt is almost always a supplementary rent card, with Chase or Amex as the daily driver. This required manual redistribution.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> persona quality matters more than persona quantity. A well-supervised set of 30 diverse personas produces better predictions than 100 identical ones. The human-in-the-loop is not optional; it's what makes the difference between useful signals and noise.</p>

The overlap between users who post across multiple years about the same product is also small, which makes it harder to track changes in the personas and their views as the world shifts. These personas represent how the <em>online community</em> thinks, not the full customer base. A "missing voices" audit and supplementary data sources (YouTube comments, app reviews, survey data) are needed for broader representativeness.</p>

      <p class="section-label">What's Next</p>
      <h2 class="section-title reveal">Future Directions</h2>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <p>This project demonstrated the framework on credit card launches using public Reddit data. But the approach generalizes far beyond this specific domain. Here's where I see this work going.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="insight-cards reveal">
        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">1</span>
          <h4>Proprietary data integration</h4>
          <p>Companies have data Reddit doesn't: spending patterns, support tickets, NPS scores, churn history. Grounding personas in internal data alongside public sentiment would dramatically improve accuracy and uncover segments that never post online.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">2</span>
          <h4>A/B testing messaging before launch</h4>
          <p>The counterfactual analysis in this project was done after the fact. The real power is running it <em>before</em> launch: test three framings of the same product, see which one the personas react to least negatively, and ship the winning message. Iterate on copy, not on apology emails.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">3</span>
          <h4>Tracking personas over time</h4>
          <p>Generate personas quarterly from the same community. Track how sentiment evolves over time. Detect early warning signs, like growing frustration with a specific feature, before they reach critical mass. A living panel instead of a one-time snapshot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">4</span>
          <h4>Multi-platform data sourcing</h4>
          <p>This project used Reddit exclusively. But customers discuss products on YouTube, Twitter/X, TikTok, and product review sites too. Pulling from multiple platforms would broaden the persona base beyond Reddit's enthusiast skew and capture segments that never post on Reddit. If the framework works for Reddit communities, it should generalize to any platform with rich public discussion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass-card insight-card">
          <span class="insight-number">5</span>
          <h4>Cross-industry application</h4>
          <p>Any product with an active online community can use this framework: SaaS pricing changes, subscription tier restructuring, hardware product refreshes, streaming service content shifts. Anywhere customers discuss products publicly, synthetic twins can predict reactions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <h3>Calibrating sentiment vs. behavior</h3>
        <p>The biggest open question from this project is the gap between what personas <em>say</em> they'll do and what real customers <em>actually</em> do. The synthetic twins predicted mass rejection; reality showed 83% adoption. Closing that gap is the most important next step. Whether that means weighting persona responses with historical behavioral data or explicitly modeling inertia and switching costs, the goal is making this framework actionable for business decisions, not just sentiment reads.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block reveal">
        <h3>From research tool to product development partner</h3>
        <p>The vision isn't a report that sits on someone's desk. It's a tool integrated into the product development cycle: before every major launch, pricing change, or feature removal, the team runs it through the synthetic panel. Not as a gate, but as a lens. The goal is to learn what your customers care about early enough that you still have room to iterate and build the product that works for your business <em>and</em> resonates with your customers, new and existing.</p>
