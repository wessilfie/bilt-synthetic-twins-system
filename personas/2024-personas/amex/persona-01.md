## Actual Reddit Quotes

**Quote 1:**
> "Story of my 3.5M Amex MR I started off with Amex Points game in 2020 and accumulated 3.5 million points with a lot of SUB and both personal and work related reimbursed travel spend. I spent around 1.5M on a couple of business class upgrades with family international trips and a few first class upgrades on international work trips. Also had a great Maldives Ritz week long holiday with my spouse for our 10th anniversary."
