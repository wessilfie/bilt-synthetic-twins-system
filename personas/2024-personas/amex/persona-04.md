## Actual Reddit Quotes

**Quote 1:**
> "My first use of a Centurion lounge: This alone justifies the price of the card. I recently had a 7-hour layover at DFW with some senior family members, and decided to make my first use of their Centurion lounge (plus $50 apiece for two guests). What a nice surprise."
