**Quote 2:**
> "Retention offer got me So I live near a united hub and had fully planned on cancelling my Amex Gold and focusing all of my spend on my newly acquired BILT card and it's amazing transfer partners. I'm on year 3 with my Gold card and was ready to cancel and eliminate a chunk of annual fees."

**Quote 3:**
> "This sub: 'Amex should have a card with 10x points on everything, retention offers every year, no AF, and lounge access for whoever I want. And it should be exclusive, because I don't want just anyone to be able to get it.' Also this sub: 'Why is the AF going up? Why are the lounges overcrowded? Why can't I get a retention offer?'"
