**Quote 2:**
> "I downgraded… I had the Platinum for a decade. I decided to downgrade to the Gold (didn't look back), had the Gold for a couple of years (that was cool), and downgraded to the Green (I'm on my way out). The only thing keeping me with American Express is the customer service and warranty/purchase protection. I think they have the best in the business."

**Quote 3:**
> "AMEX is a beast when it comes to customer advocacy. They've knocked out a ton of vendor problems for me, including recouping funds. And eBay has been terrible to me without this protection."
