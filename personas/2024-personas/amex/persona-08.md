- Schwab cash-out rate dropped from 1.1 to 0.8 cpp
- Annual fee increases across all cards add up when holding multiple

**Customer Service Experiences:**

---

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Massive business expenses that generate hundreds of thousands of MR points per year
- The 250K welcome offer was too good to pass up
- Ability to consolidate business and personal spend in one ecosystem

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- A financial review resulting in account closure
- If Schwab cash-out is eliminated entirely
- If business card benefits continue to erode

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- At $500K+ annual spend, the annual fee is trivial compared to points earned
- Evaluates based on total MR earned vs total fees paid across all cards
- Business expenses are reimbursed, making the fee essentially paid by the business

---

## Spending & Payment Behavior

**Categories They Optimize For:**
- Business expenses (consulting, travel, client entertainment) — 2/3 of total
- Personal expenses — 1/3 of total
- Large one-time purchases (watches, equipment) on cards with purchase protection

**Payment Habits:** Always pay in full (carries no balance ever)
**How They Track/Redeem Rewards:**
- Monitors MR balance across all cards
- Hit 1M points in a single calendar year
- Strategic about Schwab cash-out timing (rushed before rate reduction)
- Uses spreadsheets to track business vs personal expense allocation

---

## Current Sentiment

**Overall Sentiment:** Neutral (loves the earn rate, frustrated by financial review risk)
**Key Themes:**
- Massive earner who sees Amex as a business tool, not a lifestyle product
- Financial review experience soured the relationship
- Feels that high spenders should be treated better, not investigated
- Considering whether the risk of account closure outweighs the benefits

**Representative Quote:**
> "I have a 800 credit score and have been an AMEX customer for 5+ years... I recently purchased my grail watch for about $20k and that apparently triggered the review."

**Recommendation Stance:**
**Would They Recommend This Card?** With caveats
**To Whom:**
- Business owners with high monthly expenses who want to earn points on spend they'd make anyway
- With the caveat that large atypical purchases can trigger invasive financial reviews

## Actual Reddit Quotes

**Quote 1:**
> "Got hit with a financial review, probably cancelling all cards I have a 800 credit score and have been an AMEX customer for 5+ years. I have gold, platinum, delta platinum, and blue cash as well as a HYSA. I use these cards for my W2 expenses and for my work I have to spend thousands of dollars each month."

— r/amex, 2024-12-19

**Quote 3:**
> "Welcome Offer changed from 120k to 250k after several visits. I've never had an Amex card before but I decided to go with the Business Platinum. During my research I came across some posts that were boasting Welcome Offers of 190k, 200k, and even 250k."

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A high-volume business spender who runs $500K+ through Amex annually but lives in fear of a financial review that could shut down his entire card ecosystem.
**Core Motivation:** Earning massive MR points on business expenses that would be spent regardless, converting them to cash or premium travel.
**Biggest Frustration:** The financial review process that treats loyal, high-spending, perfect-payment customers as liabilities because of a single unusual purchase.
**Likely Next Move:** If financial review clears, continue maximizing business spend; if not, may reluctantly move business expenses to Chase Ink or Capital One Spark.
