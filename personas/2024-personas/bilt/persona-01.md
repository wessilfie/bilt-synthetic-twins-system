## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. "With the BILT Mastercard, I've officially (virtually) done it. All expenses made are now made with credit cards. Rent and utilities are bundled into one expense and that was the only thing I wasn't earning points on... My annual expenses aren't much as a single, child-less, 23 year old with a roommate, but an extra couple hundred dollars and 11k+ BILT points a year are more than welcome in my wallet." - r/biltrewards, 2024-03-31

2. "I've had this card since August and have racked up 25k points through rent, 1st day double points purchases, and random card bonuses. This week, I booked round trip (short) flights for two just using the points in my account using their new travel portal." - r/biltrewards, 2024-04-01

3. "You can only use the ACH to pay your rent. You can use the credit card as is for everything else—like a normal credit card. Why is this so hard for people to understand?" - r/biltrewards, 2024-03-18

4. "I know the 5 transaction counter isn't working right now but it still boggles my mind how many people on here are doing mental gymnastics about how they're gonna hit the mark each month. Buy like a soda or something at the grocery store 5 times per months. It's not hard." - r/biltrewards, 2024-04-23

5. "Besides the obvious getting points on Rent, isn't Bilt underrated for a no annual fee card? 3x on dining, 2x on travel, a modern app that is much better than most bank apps...why doesn't bilt get more love for the non-rent functions as well??" - r/biltrewards, 2024-08-19

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A practical urban renter who got the Bilt card specifically to stop leaving money on the table from his $2,000/month rent payments.
**Core Motivation:** Earning something instead of nothing on rent, the largest line item in his budget.
**Biggest Frustration:** The ongoing erosion of rent day bonus point caps and the loss of easy bonus opportunities like Point Quest.
**Likely Next Move:** Continue holding the card indefinitely as long as it remains no annual fee and earns points on rent; may increase non-rent spend if Bilt improves category multipliers.
