## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. "Unpopular opinion but I think people are asking too much from a free card that gives you points on rent. I understand the disappointment but it's a free card" - r/biltrewards, 2024-03-13

2. "I'm fed up with bilt. I'm so fed up with bilt. No annual fee? Free points on rent? A card that gives me 3x points on dining, among the best in class? An app that occasionally gives me the opportunity to win free rent and points? Great transfer partners like united, hyatt, and more? Like jeez, can this card get ANY worse? For real though, everyone is acting entitled." - r/biltrewards, 2024-04-04

3. "Both won't knock anyone's socks off but the fact that Bilt is giving away free points for a free card is still extremely generous of them." - r/biltrewards, 2024-02-28

4. "The fact it has transfer partners (some being insanely valuable like Alaska and Hyatt) with $0 annual fee and no foreign transaction fees....is beyond absurd." - r/biltrewards, 2024-08-19

5. "As for transfer bonuses, I don't know how Bilt can financially justify them. I don't know when we will see it again, but I am happy to have United, Hyatt and Alaska as transfer partners. I don't understand why people are so disappointed with the card. In my opinion, it is the best free card; even for people who doesn't pay rent." - r/biltrewards, 2024-05-08
