## Pain Points & Frustrations

**Complaints About the Card/Issuer:**
- Losing American Airlines as a transfer partner in June 2024 was a significant blow
- Alaska Airlines is a partial replacement but does not fully cover AA's domestic network, especially on the East Coast
- Rent day bonus point cap reduced from 10,000 to 1,000 in October 2024
- Wells Fargo backend creates friction with credit limits and lack of authorized user support

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**
- Status tier milestones are "hilariously bad" with 1,000 point caps
- Rent day promotions have become less travel-focused and more lifestyle/fitness oriented
- The card's earning structure outside rent and dining (1x everything else) is uncompetitive

**Customer Service Experiences:**
- Finds the dual Bilt/Wells Fargo app situation frustrating for a sophisticated user
- Has had smooth transfer experiences but worries about partner stability

---

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Hyatt as a 1:1 transfer partner on a no-annual-fee card was unheard of
- Rent earning turned a dead expense into a points pipeline

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- Losing Hyatt as a transfer partner would be devastating
- If transfer ratios were devalued to less than 1:1

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- No annual fee makes the math trivially positive
- Even without rent, 3x dining with Hyatt transfers rivals cards with $250+ annual fees
- Would likely pay a reasonable annual fee if Bilt Card 2.0 added premium benefits

---

## Spending & Payment Behavior

**Categories They Optimize For:**
- Rent (1x, $2,500/month, transferred to Hyatt)
- Dining (3x, uses for restaurant spend when Amex Gold is not more advantageous)
- Strategic rent day spending for double points on miscellaneous purchases

**Payment Habits:** Always pays in full; never pays interest
**How They Track/Redeem Rewards:**
- Reads Boarding Area, FlyerTalk, r/biltrewards, and points blogs daily
- Tracks transfer bonuses and times large transfers to coincide with rent day promotions
- Maintains spreadsheet of points balances across all programs

---

## Current Sentiment

**Overall Sentiment:** Positive but watchful; concerned about partner erosion
**Key Themes:**
- Treats Bilt as a key node in a broader points strategy, not a standalone card
- AA departure was a wake-up call; closely monitors Hyatt partnership stability
- Appreciates Bilt VP Richard Kerr's transparency on Reddit about partner decisions

**Representative Quote:**
> "Bilt losing AA as a transfer partner in June... I'd call this a fairly significant loss for Bilt; losing Hyatt would be the only bigger one. Definitely makes me less likely to use the card."

**Recommendation Stance:** Recommends to points-savvy users
**Would They Recommend This Card?** Yes, with caveats
**To Whom:**
- Experienced churners who understand transfer partner value
- Renters who already have Chase/Amex ecosystems and want another transfer pipeline
- Anyone paying high rent in HCOL areas

## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. "Bilt losing AA as a transfer partner in June... I'd call this a fairly significant loss for Bilt; losing Hyatt would be the only bigger one. Definitely makes me less likely to use the card, in addition to its recent 'enhanced' status requirements without any corresponding benefits." - r/biltrewards, 2024-03-13

2. "I assure you Hyatt is not leaving as a transfer partner - Kerr, VP Travel for Bilt" - r/biltrewards, 2024-10-14

3. "BILT adds Alaska Airlines as transfer partner. The rumors are true. As American Airlines and BILT are set to split up soon they announce Alaska Airlines as a travel partner. I still prefer American Airlines but it's nice being able to book One World flights through Alaska Airlines." - r/biltrewards, 2024-03-15

4. "Bilt losing AA as a partner sucks if you live on the east coast. I just looked at Alaskan Airlines route for flights leaving Philly and it's to like 6 places on the west coast and that's it." - r/biltrewards, 2024-03-17

5. "I mean, it's a zero AF card that lets you charge rent and has two of the most sought after transfer partners in the game (Alaska and Hyatt). I'd say it's worth it (if you qualify) considering your 'cost' is basically zero." - r/biltrewards, 2024-12-03

**One-Line Description:** A sophisticated points strategist who uses Bilt as a Hyatt transfer pipeline and was shaken by the AA partnership loss in June 2024.
**Core Motivation:** Maximizing transfer partner value, especially Bilt-to-Hyatt, as part of a multi-card points optimization strategy.
**Biggest Frustration:** The loss of American Airlines as a transfer partner and the fear that Hyatt could be next.
**Likely Next Move:** Will closely evaluate Bilt Card 2.0 tiered offerings; may increase spend if a premium tier adds meaningful travel benefits; will immediately transfer all points out if Hyatt partnership shows signs of instability.
