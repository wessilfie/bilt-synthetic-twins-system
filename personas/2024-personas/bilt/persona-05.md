## Pain Points & Frustrations

- The Bilt app is chaotic, slow to load, and constantly changing its UI

- Navigation is messy with too many sections and duplicate functionality
- Finding transaction history is sometimes a multi-step process

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**

- Wells Fargo's app is a poorly wrapped web view for most functionality
- 5-transaction counter has been unreliable

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Transferable points on rent with no annual fee was too good to pass up
- The tech-forward branding appealed to him as a software developer

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- Would not cancel (no fee) but would reduce engagement if app quality continues to decline
- If a competitor built a better rent rewards product with a superior app experience

- No annual fee means the card stays in his wallet regardless
- Values his time; the app friction is a real cost even if the dollar cost is zero

## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. "The Bilt App is a Mess. This is kind of a rant, but I've grown increasingly frustrated with using the Bilt app... I really like the card - but the app is probably my least favorite app experience of any of the banking apps I use." - r/biltrewards, 2024-11-18

2. "Because of their partnership with Wells Fargo, you pretty much need to keep and use both apps to manage this single card. Wells Fargo's app is basically a poorly wrapped web view for most the functionality so that aspect isn't great either." - r/biltrewards, 2024-11-18

3. "PSA: Set up a Wells Fargo Login. Mini rant incoming. Look people, it's not hard. I see so many complaints about not knowing payment dates. Transaction weirdness, etc. People, this is a Wells Fargo credit card! Ok? Just log into Wells and you will see it there." - r/biltrewards, 2024-01-16

4. "Bilt team needs a spell checker" - r/biltrewards, 2024-07-30

5. "'Neighborhood Dining' search is wack. I live in an enormous city; Los Angeles. When I tap on 'Neighborhood' it doesn't show any restaurants which are remotely near me... HEY BILT. ADD A MAP FUNCTION TO YOUR RESTAURANT SEARCH AND I MIGHT USE SOME OF YOUR PARTNERS SOME DAY" - r/biltrewards, 2024-05-18

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A tech worker who loves the Bilt card's value proposition but is deeply frustrated by the chaotic, slow, and overcomplicated app experience.
**Core Motivation:** Earning transferable points on rent and dining through a modern digital platform, though the platform itself falls short of his standards.
**Biggest Frustration:** The Bilt app's constant UI changes, slow loading, and the need to juggle two apps (Bilt + Wells Fargo) for one credit card.
**Likely Next Move:** Will keep the card but hopes Bilt Card 2.0 brings a complete app overhaul; may become more vocal in providing feedback if the app experience does not improve.
