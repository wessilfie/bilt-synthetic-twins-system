- Misses the 5x welcome bonus period and the generosity of early Bilt

**Representative Quote:**
> "Joke's on them, I don't pay interest - ever. And I run a lot of spend through the card, most of it on rent day to double the points. Good to know I'm burning a hole in WF's balance sheet. Guess I'll keep doing it until 2029."

**Recommendation Stance:** Mixed; recommends for rent earning but warns about devaluations
**Would They Recommend This Card?** Yes, but with lower enthusiasm than before
**To Whom:**
- Budget-conscious renters who want something for their rent payments
- People who understand the rent day double points have been significantly capped

2. "The rent day devaluation and they way they tried to hide it is sketchy. I am going to just be transferring all my points regularly to united and am now going to be spending the bare minimum instead of saving bills to the first of the month." - r/biltrewards, 2024-08-22

3. "I save any random bills, Amazon shopping, or larger transactions for rent day assuming I'd get 2x points. Only my Allstate payment was doubled. Everything else (TJ Maxx shopping, Amazon, Medical Bills, kids daycare tuition, only earned 1x)" - r/biltrewards, 2024-10-03

4. "How much were you all spending on rent day to make Bilt initiate a 10,000 points Rent day cap? I imagine this was a small group of power users? Bilt isn't making this change because of my small spending." - r/biltrewards, 2024-07-27

5. "Starting October 1st, rent day double points capped at 1000 (down from 10k)" - r/biltrewards, 2024-08-02

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A rent day maximizer who concentrated all monthly spending on the 1st for double points, only to have his core strategy undermined by the October 2024 cap reduction.
**Core Motivation:** Extracting maximum points by channeling every possible dollar through the Bilt card on rent day for double earning.
**Biggest Frustration:** The rent day double points cap being slashed from 10,000 to 1,000 points, which destroyed his carefully constructed monthly spending strategy.
**Likely Next Move:** Will continue earning on rent but stop delaying purchases to rent day; may start transferring points to United regularly rather than stockpiling; will evaluate Bilt Card 2.0 to see if new tiers restore rent day value.
