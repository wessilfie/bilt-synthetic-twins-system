## Pain Points & Frustrations

**Complaints About the Card/Issuer:**
- Lives in constant low-grade anxiety that Hyatt will leave as a transfer partner, especially after AA departed
- When Hyatt briefly disappeared from the Bilt hotel search in October 2024, she panicked
- Wishes Bilt offered a premium tier with enhanced Hyatt earning or transfer bonuses
- Credit limit is too low to cover rent plus significant monthly spending

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**
- Rent day transfer bonuses have been inconsistent; not always targeted at Hyatt
- Would love a dedicated Hyatt transfer bonus more frequently
- The Bilt travel portal (powered by Expedia/Awayz) offers poor value compared to direct Hyatt transfers

**Customer Service Experiences:**
- Positive experience getting Hilton Gold status match; used it to chain a National Executive Elite status match
- Had a scare when Hyatt disappeared from the app search but was reassured by Richard Kerr's Reddit post

---

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- 1:1 Hyatt transfer on a no-annual-fee card was the single deciding factor
- Already had the Chase Sapphire Reserve and World of Hyatt Visa, so adding another Hyatt pipeline was strategically valuable

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- Losing Hyatt as a transfer partner would immediately eliminate her primary reason for holding the card
- If transfer ratios were devalued below 1:1

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- At $0 annual fee, the card is an incredible Hyatt feeder
- Her $2,400/month rent generates 28,800 points/year, worth approximately $576 at 2 cpp through Hyatt
- Would pay up to $150 annual fee if it came with enhanced Hyatt benefits or a welcome bonus

---

## Spending & Payment Behavior

**Categories They Optimize For:**
- Rent (1x, $2,400/month, all transferred to Hyatt)
- Dining (3x, supplements Hyatt point balance)
- Strategic purchases on rent day for double points
- Monitors rent day for Hyatt or hotel-related transfer bonuses

**Payment Habits:** Pays in full every month; automates through Wells Fargo
**How They Track/Redeem Rewards:**
- Maintains a target Hyatt redemption list (aspirational properties she wants to visit)
- Transfers points to Hyatt in large batches when she has enough for a specific booking
- Monitors r/biltrewards and r/awardtravel for Hyatt sweet spot redemptions

---

2. "Booked a Hyatt for 30,000 Bilt points that otherwise would have been $770. Is my math correct that the redemption is 2.5 cents per point?" - r/biltrewards, 2024-07-19

3. "Is Hyatt leaving? Usually Hyatt shows as a search option in Bilt's hotel transfer tab. But recently it has stopped appearing for me... The transfer points page still offer Hyatt though so wondering if this is an issue with awayz or if I missed something and Hyatt will be removed." - r/biltrewards, 2024-10-13

4. "Booking domestic AA flights through Alaska. Air France travel to Europe. Hyatt hotels. Bilt points are possibly the most valuable on the market with a lot of great transfer options." - r/biltrewards, 2024-10-28

5. "I live in NYC so I pay about $54,000 in rent per year. So the points I get from Bilt are worth about $1,080 per year if I transfer to Hyatt and redeem at 2 cents per point. I'd absolutely pay an annual fee for the Bilt card to keep earning those points." - r/biltrewards, 2024-06-16

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A Hyatt-obsessed optimizer who uses Bilt as a free pipeline to fund aspirational hotel stays, living in constant awareness that the Hyatt partnership is the card's most valuable and most fragile asset.
**Core Motivation:** Converting rent payments into Hyatt hotel nights through the uniquely valuable 1:1 Bilt-to-Hyatt transfer on a no-annual-fee card.
**Biggest Frustration:** The ever-present fear that Hyatt could follow American Airlines out the door as a Bilt transfer partner.
**Likely Next Move:** Will continue maximizing Hyatt transfers; may be an early adopter of Bilt Card 2.0 if a premium tier offers enhanced hotel transfer bonuses or Hyatt-specific benefits; would immediately transfer all remaining points to Hyatt at any sign of partnership instability.
