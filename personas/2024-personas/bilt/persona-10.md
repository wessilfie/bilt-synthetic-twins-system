## Pain Points & Frustrations

**Complaints About the Card/Issuer:**
- Mortgage payment feature has been teased since early 2024 but is still not launched
- Frustrated by the slow rollout timeline; has seen "coming soon" messaging for months
- The "buy a home" tool is interesting but not yet fully fleshed out
- Low credit limit despite good credit and income; worried about approval for a higher limit when he needs it for rent + spending

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**
- Wishes the credit reporting feature was promoted more heavily; it is genuinely valuable for his mortgage preparation
- The 0.5x earning on home purchases (1 point per $2) requires using a Bilt-affiliated agent, limiting flexibility
- Points used for "cover rent" get poor value (approximately 0.9 cpp) compared to transfer partners

**Customer Service Experiences:**
- Positive interaction when inquiring about the home buying program
- Successfully requested a credit limit increase with a soft pull (per community data points)

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- The promise of eventually earning points on mortgage payments was the long-term play
- Free credit reporting on rent builds his credit file for a future mortgage application
- Earning points on rent in the meantime means he is not leaving money on the table during his renting years

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- Would not cancel (no fee) but would be disappointed if mortgage features never materialize
- If he buys a home and Bilt has no mortgage earning, the card loses most of its value
- If credit reporting stopped being free

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- No annual fee makes it risk-free to hold while waiting for mortgage features
- The credit reporting alone has tangible value for his credit profile
- Would gladly pay an annual fee for a card that earns meaningful points on mortgage payments

**Categories They Optimize For:**
- Rent (1x, $1,700/month, the core earning category)

## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. "Congrats on the new home! Stay tuned though... we're working on points on mortgage payments!" - r/biltrewards (Bilt official account), 2024-04-02

2. "Come on! Do mortgages already! Dear Bilt. I saw a January 2024 article that said you were working on expanding to allow for mortgage payments. Any update?" - r/biltrewards, 2024-07-25

3. "Language in the website changed from 'Rent' to 'Residential'. Are mortgage payments arriving? I just noticed that the website wording changed from 'Rent payments' to 'Residential payments' in many (though not all) places. This seems like a move towards allowing other residential payments, such as mortgage, utilities, HOA fees." - r/biltrewards, 2024-08-21

4. "Bilt just added a 'buy home' option to get 0.5x per dollar on home purchase" - r/biltrewards, 2024-11-21

5. "We just announced a few new things... Most importantly, we have a new point offering that is truly exceptional. Buying a home with one of our affiliated agents will get you 1 point for every $2 of the home price. That's 250,000 points if you buy the average home of $500,000. There's no limit, so if you want to buy a $2M home you'll get 1M points." - r/biltrewards, 2024-11-22
