## Pain Points & Frustrations

- Despite spending $15K-$30K/month for 19 years, got no leniency
- Customer service was unable or unwilling to override automated systems

**Quote 2:**
> "Cancelling my platinum card as a 10 year member As the title says, I've been an Amex member for 10 years. I'll be cancelling my platinum card next week. I have the platinum card for one reason, and only one reason: to sit in airport lounges and have a nice meal."

**Quote 3:**
> "I cancelled my Amex Plat after 6 years Didn't think I would have the card for so long but every year, the benefits seemed worth it. I seriously considered cancelling last year but they had a great retention offer. This year, I didn't get any retention offer."

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A high-spending, 19-year Platinum member who is finally cancelling after a billing error exposed how little Amex values long-time loyalty.
**Core Motivation:** Expects that two decades of loyalty and six-figure annual spend should mean something when problems arise.
**Biggest Frustration:** Automated systems and rigid policies that treat a 19-year, never-missed-a-payment customer the same as a brand-new applicant.
**Likely Next Move:** Cancel all Amex cards, move to Chase Sapphire Reserve ecosystem, and share his cautionary tale on Reddit to warn other long-time members.
