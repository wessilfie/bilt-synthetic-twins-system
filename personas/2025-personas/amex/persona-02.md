- The Houston Centurion Lounge experience was a breaking point
- Priority Pass restaurants are eliminating Amex acceptance
- Lounges feel like "crowded airport cafeterias" not premium experiences

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**

- International Centurion Lounges are vastly inferior to US ones (except Japan)
- The gap between Centurion marketing and reality is growing

**Customer Service Experiences:**
- Mixed — phone support is still decent but chat is terrible
- Feels like the company is coasting on brand equity rather than earning loyalty

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Centurion Lounge access was the singular deciding factor
- As a frequent business traveler, a premium airport experience was worth the fee

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- If Capital One Lounges expand to enough airports to replace Centurion
- If overcrowding makes the lounge experience functionally useless
- Already seriously considering it after the Houston experience

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- Values lounge access at $50-80 per visit × 20+ visits = $1,000-$1,600 in value
- But this calculation breaks down when you're waiting 45 minutes to get in
- Compares unfavorably to Japan's Centurion lounges (fresh sushi, no wait)

---

- Hotel stays through FHR or Amex Travel

**Payment Habits:** Always pay in full
**How They Track/Redeem Rewards:**
- Accumulates MR through heavy travel spend
- Transfers to Delta for domestic flights
- Saves large balances for aspirational transfers to ANA

**Quote 3:**
> "Airport lounges are just not worth it anymore This is pretty much a rant, and I have seen a lot of people here complaining about the same, so might as well just add some more fuel to the fire. Lounges are just not worth it anymore."
— r/amex, 2025-07-13

**Quote 4:**
> "Amex Centurion lounge getting fancy with drinks Promoting F1 tie-in on cappuccinos at SEA. There was a bit of a line to get in but it is always worth it compared to the alternatives."
— r/amex, 2025-03-17

**Quote 5:**
> "This is the modern world of lounges, it's not a centurion problem exclusively. It's really just a glorified buffet anyways, it's never been anything other than that. A nice quick stop and refresher before a flight."

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A frequent business traveler whose love affair with Centurion Lounges is ending as overcrowding destroys the premium experience he pays $695 for.
**Core Motivation:** A genuinely premium airport experience that makes 20+ annual flights tolerable and productive.
**Biggest Frustration:** 45-minute waits, digital waitlists, and declining food quality at Centurion Lounges — a far cry from the made-to-order sushi in Japan.
**Likely Next Move:** Monitor Capital One Lounge expansion; if they add 5-6 more airports, switch to Venture X as primary card and drop the Platinum.
