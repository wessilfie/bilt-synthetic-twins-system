- Views the "profit" margin as justification even before lounge access and points

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** An analytical optimizer who treats the Platinum card as a mathematical puzzle, methodically extracting more value from credits than the annual fee costs.
**Core Motivation:** Proving — with spreadsheets — that the Platinum card's credits exceed the annual fee through disciplined usage.
**Biggest Frustration:** The cognitive overhead of tracking dozens of credits across different cadences (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual).
**Likely Next Move:** Continue holding the Platinum with her tracking system, update her Reddit benefits guide after the refresh, and evangelize the "checklist approach" to anyone who'll listen.
