## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Gold card's dining and grocery multipliers fit his lifestyle perfectly

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** An urban renter who loves Amex Gold's earning rates but got burned trying to earn points on his biggest monthly expense — rent.
**Core Motivation:** Earning maximum points on all spending categories, including the ~$2,000/month rent that currently earns nothing.
**Biggest Frustration:** Amex's hostile stance toward rent payments when competitors like Bilt embrace them as a core feature.
**Likely Next Move:** Add Bilt Mastercard for rent payments, keep Amex Gold for dining and grocery, and build a multi-card strategy that covers all spending categories.
