## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- The 175K Business Gold welcome offer was a "can't miss" opportunity
- Already running significant business spend through other cards — Amex consolidation made sense
- Wanted to maximize points on large, irregular business expenses

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- If MR transfer values decline significantly
- If financial review risk becomes too high with variable spend
- If a competitor offers better business card earning rates

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- At $100K+ annual business spend, the annual fee is trivial
- Evaluates on points earned per dollar of annual fee paid
- Views the Business Gold's $375 AF as the best value in the Amex lineup for business spend

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A scrappy business owner who treats every Amex card as a profit-generating tool, aggressively negotiating with merchants and timing large purchases to maximize sign-up bonuses.
**Core Motivation:** Turning unavoidable business expenses into travel rewards and cash value through strategic card usage and SUB stacking.
**Biggest Frustration:** Merchants who refuse Amex due to the 3% interchange fee, and the ever-present threat of financial review from variable spend patterns.
**Likely Next Move:** Continue cycling through business card welcome offers; add a Chase Ink card for merchants that won't accept Amex; push all possible spend through Amex while the earning rates hold.
