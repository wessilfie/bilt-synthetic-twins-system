## Decision Triggers

## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. > "BILT 2.0: A Cost Restructure Disguised as an Upgrade (AKA Wells Fargo Wants Their Cut) ... the changes feel more like a shift in cost structure rather than a genuine improvement."

2. > "If BILT gets rid of the waived 3% fee on rent, or makes you pay an annual fee for a card with rent benefits, they will undoubtedly go out of business. No one, including me would continue using the card if they slash the 3% fee waive on rent."
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-02-06, 303 upvotes

3. > "With Bilt Card 2.0 it's becoming clear what type of customer they want to court (not me) ... I got into Bilt for 3x dining, good transfer partners, and transfer bonuses."
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-02-07, 136 upvotes

4. > "Seriously, what are the 'loopholes'? ... If they didn't want people using the card on rent and then 4 insignificant purchases each month, then they should have upped the initial minimum transactions ... Just say the initial structure isn't sustainable lmao"
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-02-08, 108 upvotes

5. > "Survey summary: If Bilt wants their card to be used more, the multipliers and categories need to be more competitive ... the only half decent card from this draft list is option A No AF. The rest don't really compete imo"

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** An analytical credit card optimizer who questions Bilt's long-term sustainability and worries that the rumored relaunch and Wells Fargo transition will gut the free tier that makes the card worth holding.
**Core Motivation:** Preserve the exceptional value of a free card with transferable points on rent before the inevitable restructure.
**Biggest Frustration:** Bilt's unit economics do not add up for a free card, and every signal suggests the relaunch will shift costs to cardholders who currently pay nothing.
**Likely Next Move:** Will stick with the no-AF Bilt card as long as it remains viable; otherwise, will shift all spend back to his Chase Sapphire Reserve ecosystem.
