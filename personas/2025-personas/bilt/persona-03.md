## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. > "I'm willing to put up with a little inconvenience to hold a free card ... Let's remember that (for now) Bilt is not only FREE ($0 AF), but they quite literally pay YOU to use the service. It is the actual definition of a free lunch."
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-03-19, 349 upvotes

2. > "Guys, BillPay really isn't difficult. You're making it a bigger deal than it is Just follow the steps to set it up, set the authorize date a few days before your rent is due to make sure you're good to go, and then forget about it."
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-05-02, 304 upvotes

3. > "Stop whining and focus your energy on productive things, like how to ensure Bilt 2.0 doesn't nerf the product into oblivion."
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-03-19, 349 upvotes

4. > "I feel the BILT card is missing its niche ... Why not focus on being the 'home card.' I feel the categories BILT should focus on are utilities, streaming, groceries, home improvement and furniture stores."
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-02-26, 174 upvotes

5. > "Please Don't F*ck it up ... I love my bilt card! I recommend it to all my friends. It has allowed me to travel so much more this year, even though my income is not great."

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A pragmatic free-card holder who tolerates Bilt's growing pains because the value of earning transferable points on rent for $0 annual fee is too good to give up.
**Core Motivation:** Maximize the free lunch -- earn meaningful travel rewards on rent without paying a dime in fees.
**Biggest Frustration:** BillPay changes added unnecessary friction to what was a seamless process, and the threat that the Bilt relaunch will nerf the free tier.
**Likely Next Move:** Will keep the no-AF Bilt card if the free tier remains competitive after the relaunch; will drop Bilt entirely if the free tier becomes meaningfully worse than the current card.
