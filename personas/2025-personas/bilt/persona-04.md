4. > "Credit cards getting linked to BILT automatically. My wife got a new credit card. That account has no reference to my details ... That card still showed up linked on my BILT account ... I know every company is tracking our data and privacy is a fairy tale, but this was a bit unnerving honestly."

5. > "I hear you; to confirm once again we do not sell member data for money. Some state laws have a very wide definition of what counts as the 'sale' of data, including things like serving targeted ads, which is why this language is included in our privacy center. - Kerr, Bilt"

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A privacy-focused software engineer who discovered Bilt's default data selling practices and now evangelizes the opt-out process while remaining a vigilant cardholder.
**Core Motivation:** Earn free rent rewards while maintaining maximum control over personal data.
**Biggest Frustration:** Bilt's opt-out process is deliberately buried behind 7+ steps, and the company's official response to data concerns feels like corporate doublespeak.
**Likely Next Move:** Will continue using the card with all privacy opt-outs enabled; will closely scrutinize the new issuer's privacy policies before transitioning and may refuse the new card if data practices worsen.
