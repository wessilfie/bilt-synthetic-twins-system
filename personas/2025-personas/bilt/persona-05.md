## Pain Points & Frustrations

- Mortgage feature was announced in January 2025 but kept getting delayed

- Unclear whether mortgage points will be at full 1x rate or reduced
- Bilt's rumored relaunch and transition away from Wells Fargo adds uncertainty at a critical time

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Points on rent in a VHCOL area
- Promise of mortgage payments announced for 2025
- Earned 182K Bilt points through home buying program

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- If mortgage earning rate is significantly below 1x on the free card
- If full mortgage rewards require a paid annual fee card
- If a competitor launches a better mortgage rewards program

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- With a $3,000+/month mortgage, even 1x points would generate 36,000+ points/year
- Would pay a moderate annual fee if it means full 1x on mortgage
- Uses CSR as his daily driver and primary benchmark; Bilt must offer differentiated value on housing spend

**Biggest Frustration:** Mortgage feature details keep shifting; concerned the relaunch may require a paid tier to get full mortgage earning rates.
