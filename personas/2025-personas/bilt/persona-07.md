## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A young, budget-conscious renter who actually won Rent Free and now views Bilt as a genuinely life-improving product that she evangelizes to everyone she knows.
**Core Motivation:** Win free rent and accumulate travel points on an expense she has to pay regardless -- all without spending a dime on fees.
**Biggest Frustration:** Worried that the Bilt relaunch will eliminate or nerf the free tier, pricing out the exact demographic that makes Rent Free wins so meaningful.
**Likely Next Move:** Will stay on the no-AF Bilt card no matter what; will continue playing Rent Free every month and slowly saving points for her first big transfer partner redemption.
