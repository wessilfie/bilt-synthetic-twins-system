## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. > "Confirmed: Flights through Bilt portal code as airline MCC- Amex Platinum 5x stack ... $2k spend at Delta turned into 2k Bilt + 10k MR. Not groundbreaking, but a nice stack that I haven't seen anyone promoting before. #BeTheDataPointYouWantToSee"
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-11-17, 397 upvotes

2. > "Using Bilt portal to book flights gets you 1x Bilt Points on all linked cards. Amex platinum gives 5x earn on flights booked directly with airlines. Usually a portal books through a third party website and you wouldn't get the platinum 5x. However, Bilt books directly with airlines. So my $1k flight got me 1k Bilt points then an addition 5k Amex membership rewards"

4. > "Alaska Atmos Summit via Bilt Rent Pay + BofA More Rewards Day = 5x Atmos Points on Rent ... This basically means I purchased roughly 10000 Atmos points with $73, plus 1250 Alaska EQM ... I would say this is an absolute steal."
