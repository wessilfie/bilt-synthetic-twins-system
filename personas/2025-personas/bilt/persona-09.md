## Actual Reddit Quotes

1. > "BILT NYE Dinner Disaster: The Fyre Festival of Fine Dining ... I redeemed 33,000 hard-earned BILT points (valued at $250 per person) for what was promised to be a luxurious 'Night on the Nile' New Year's Eve dinner in Miami. Spoiler alert: it turned into the Fyre Festival of fine dining"

2. > "Bilt NYE Dining Experience at K'Far ... Beyond the pre-fixe menu, there was zero mention of Bilt or any branding. I've done experiences with Delta's SkyMiles Experiences and Marriott Bonvoy Moments, and they make you feel part of something exclusive and special. Bilt completely missed the mark here."

3. > "Bilt Neighborhood Comedy Review (Chicago) - 4/10 ... The comedy was rough. The host didn't do any crowd work or any real engagement with the audience ... My partner and I ended up leaving 30 minutes in because it was so painful."

4. > "Stop changing the app every day. Where are the Transactions?? ... you have got to stop constantly changing the app. It has to be one of the worst designed apps. It's really difficult to navigate."
   - r/biltrewards, 2025-08-10, 203 upvotes

5. > "It was nice while it lasted... Bilt is no longer leading with rewards. They are leading with 'membership' and lifestyle ... Rent Day seems more about experiences, celebrity tie ins, delivery promos, and sweepstakes."

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A lifestyle-oriented cardholder who was drawn in by Bilt's experiential marketing but was burned by the disastrous NYE dinner and consistently underwhelming events.
**Core Motivation:** Wanted a credit card that delivered unique, memorable experiences alongside rent rewards -- not just points math.
**Biggest Frustration:** Bilt's experiential offerings are consistently poorly executed, from the NYE "Fyre Festival" dinner to overpriced comedy nights with open-mic-quality acts.
**Likely Next Move:** Will continue using the free card for rent rewards but has stopped redeeming points for Bilt experiences; will transfer to Hyatt for hotel stays instead of trusting Bilt events.
