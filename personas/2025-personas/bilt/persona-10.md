---

## What They Value Most

**Reward Priority:** Accumulating Bilt points for JAL Mileage Bank transfers to fly to Japan in premium cabins
**Benefits They Actually Use:**
- 1x points on rent
- 3x on dining (uses Bilt over other cards when stacking for JAL transfers on Rent Day)
- Transfer partners, specifically Japan Airlines
- Rent Day transfer bonuses
- Alaska Airlines status benefits paired with JAL partnership

**Transfer Partners They Care About:**
- Japan Airlines (primary -- the reason the card became his most valuable)
- Alaska Airlines (for OneWorld partner bookings and status)
- Hyatt (for Japan hotel stays)
- Aeroplan (for Star Alliance backup routing)

**Favorite Redemption:** JAL Mileage Bank for business class Tokyo flights using Bilt transfers

---

## Pain Points & Frustrations

**Complaints About the Card/Issuer:**
- JAL requires 60-day account age for redemptions (Bilt negotiated an exclusion but it still takes 3-7 days)
- JAL devaluation was announced shortly after the transfer partnership launched
- Worried future devaluations will erode the value of hoarded Bilt points
- BillPay changes added friction to the rent payment process
- App UX makes it hard to track transactions

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**
- JAL devaluation risk hangs over the entire strategy
- Bilt's rumored relaunch may reduce the dining multiplier from 3x, which would slow point accumulation
- Points earning is inherently slow at 1x rent; needs strong dining multiplier to build balance faster

**Customer Service Experiences:**
- JAL account linking was smooth
- Transfer to JAL Mileage Bank took about 10 minutes as promised
- General Bilt support is adequate but not impressive

---

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Initially: free points on rent
- What made it essential: JAL added as 1:1 transfer partner in May 2025
- "And just like that, the Bilt card became the most valuable card in my wallet"

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- If JAL transfer ratio drops below 1:1
- If the relaunch gates airline transfers behind premium tiers
- If JAL devaluations make Mileage Bank redemptions uncompetitive

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- Currently $0 AF makes Bilt the best way to accumulate JAL miles in North America
- Bilt is the first and only 1:1 JAL transfer partner in North America -- massive competitive advantage
- Would pay a moderate annual fee if it maintained 1:1 JAL transfers and 3x dining

---

## Spending & Payment Behavior

**Categories They Optimize For:**
- Rent ($2,300/month) on Bilt for 1x
- Dining on Amex Gold (4x) for everyday meals; uses Bilt (3x) on Rent Day when transfer bonuses apply
- Groceries on Amex Gold (4x)
- General travel on Chase Sapphire Preferred

**Payment Habits:** Pays in full monthly; disciplined saver
**How They Track/Redeem Rewards:**
- Monitors JAL award availability on award search tools
- Times transfers to Rent Day bonuses when JAL is featured
- Created a JAL Mileage Bank account immediately when the partnership was announced
- Tracks Bilt points in a spreadsheet alongside JAL miles

4. > "Does anyone else use their Bilt Mastercard more than just 5 transactions per month? I'm starting to use it more for all dining to stack points for Japan Airlines next year."

5. > "This is fucking awesome for award travel enthusiasts because way fewer Bilt points will enter the other ecosystems as a result. People are way more likely to blow a few thousand on their occasional Southwest trips than save up hundreds of thousands to transfer to Alaska or JAL for saver awards. We should be dancing in the streets lol"

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A Japan travel enthusiast who was transformed into a Bilt evangelist when JAL was added as the first 1:1 North American transfer partner, making the free Bilt card his most valuable card.
**Core Motivation:** Accumulate enough Bilt points to fly JAL business class to Tokyo using the only free 1:1 JAL transfer currency available in North America.
**Biggest Frustration:** JAL devaluation announced shortly after the partnership launched, and the risk that Bilt's relaunch could gate airline transfers behind premium annual fee tiers.
**Likely Next Move:** Will continue stacking Bilt points aggressively through rent and Rent Day dining bonuses; will transfer to JAL before any further devaluations; will select whichever Bilt card maintains 1:1 JAL transfers and 3x dining.
