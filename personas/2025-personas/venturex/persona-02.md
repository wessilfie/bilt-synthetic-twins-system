## Pain Points & Frustrations

**Complaints About the Card/Issuer:**
- Guest access removal is a dealbreaker for couples who travel together
- Feels like bait-and-switch: signed up specifically for guest lounge access
- No +1 for primary cardholder is unreasonable even if AU changes are justified
- Having to pay $35 per guest visit or get partner their own card feels like double-dipping

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**
- Lounge access without a +1 is essentially worthless for couples travelers
- Priority Pass restaurants are not a real substitute for lounge access
- The card went from "best couples travel card" to "solo-only card" overnight

**Customer Service Experiences:**
- Called immediately on June 3rd to file a complaint about guest access
- Rep was understanding but confirmed the policy change was final
- Felt frustrated that frontline staff could not escalate or offer any compromise

---

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Reddit reviews specifically mentioning free guest access (2 max) to C1 lounges
- Frequently travels with significant other; shared lounge access was the clincher
- Low effective annual fee compared to Amex Platinum

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- Guest access policy remaining at zero guests for primary cardholder
- Would downgrade if partner has to get their own separate $395 card
- Considering Chase Sapphire Reserve or Amex Gold as alternatives

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- $395 - $300 credit - 10K miles = essentially free, BUT only if lounge access works for both of them
- If partner needs own card, the household cost doubles to $790 for what used to be included
- Without guest access, sees the card as a glorified 2% cashback card

---

## Spending & Payment Behavior

**Categories They Optimize For:**
- Travel (flights and hotels for couples trips)
- Dining out (frequent date nights)
- General everyday spend on VX for 2x

**Payment Habits:** Pays full balance monthly; puts all shared expenses on VX
**How They Track/Redeem Rewards:**
- Uses C1 app to monitor points and book travel through portal
- Prefers simple redemptions: travel eraser or portal bookings
- Starting to learn about transfer partners after reading r/Venturex

---

## Current Sentiment

**Overall Sentiment:** Deeply frustrated and considering alternatives
**Key Themes:**
- The card lost its core value proposition for couples
- Feels the change was a bait-and-switch since she signed up recently
- Willing to accept AU restrictions but not zero guest access for primary holder
- Actively evaluating whether to keep or downgrade before next annual fee

**Representative Quote:**
> "I already called to file a complaint. I can understand taking away the authorized user loophole but no +1 for my partner is a no-go. Will probably downgrade or go to another product by next year if this sticks."

**Recommendation Stance:** Would NOT recommend for couples
**Would They Recommend This Card?** No, not for anyone who travels with a partner
**To Whom:**
- Would only recommend to solo travelers now
- Tells friends to look at Amex Platinum or Chase Sapphire Reserve instead

## Persona Summary

**One-Line Description:** A couples traveler who signed up for the Venture X largely for its guest lounge access, and now feels the card's core value proposition has been gutted by the June 2025 changes.
**Core Motivation:** Sharing premium travel experiences with her partner without paying double for two separate premium cards.
**Biggest Frustration:** Losing the ability to bring her partner into Capital One Lounges, which was the single biggest reason she chose this card.
**Likely Next Move:** Will likely downgrade to VentureOne at next annual fee date unless Capital One introduces at least a +1 guest policy; actively researching Chase Sapphire Reserve and Amex Gold as replacements.
