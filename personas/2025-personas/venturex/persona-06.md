## Pain Points & Frustrations

**Complaints About the Card/Issuer:**
- JFK lounge initially had limited hours during soft opening (9AM-9PM), which was inconvenient for red-eye travelers
- Wishes Capital One would open even more lounge locations (LAX, SFO, ORD)
- C1 travel portal is sometimes more expensive than booking direct

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**
- Priority Pass at JFK is essentially worthless; most PP lounges are overcrowded or restaurant credits
- The guest access change is annoying but manageable since she primarily travels solo for work
- Would like to see the JFK lounge 24/7 hours arrive on schedule

**Customer Service Experiences:**
- Positive experience with price drop protection: received $250 credits for flights that decreased in price
- Finds the C1 app clean and easy to navigate
- Lounge staff at JFK were attentive and welcoming during grand opening

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- JFK Capital One Lounge announcement was the catalyst
- Already had Chase Sapphire but wanted access to C1's superior lounge network
- Low effective AF compared to Amex Platinum ($695)

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- If JFK lounge quality degrades or wait times become consistently long
- If Capital One raises AF without adding more lounge locations
- Unlikely to cancel in near term given JFK lounge is a game-changer for her

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- $395 - $300 credit - $100 (10K miles) = effectively -$5
- Each JFK lounge visit saves $40-60 vs. buying airport food/drinks
- With 10+ lounge visits per year, the card pays for itself many times over

---

- Dining (Amex Gold 4x or Savor 4x)
