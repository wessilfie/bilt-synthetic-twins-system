---

## Pain Points & Frustrations

**Complaints About the Card/Issuer:**
- Capital One Offers page does not let you sort by highest reward value; had to build his own tool
- Some portal offers do not track properly; requires follow-up with customer service
- The 60-day waiting period before transferring miles to partners is annoying
- Offers disappear without warning; deals can be gone before you act

**Benefits They Feel Are Degraded or Undervalued:**
- The shopping portal interface is clunky and unsorted; C1 should invest in better UX
- Some of the best portal offers (Yield Street, Stamps.com) get removed quickly
- Would like more transparency on when offers will expire or change

**Customer Service Experiences:**
- Mixed: some portal tracking issues resolved easily, others required supervisor escalation
- "Just call the number at the back, ask for shopping portal and ask for supervisor, first level of customer support can only give up to $100"
- Appreciates that the community shares tips on how to escalate effectively

## Decision Triggers

**What Made Them Get This Card:**
- Saw the potential to earn massive bonus miles through Capital One Offers (10x-41x deals)
- The near-zero effective AF meant he could justify the card even without heavy travel
- r/Venturex community showed him deal-stacking strategies

**What Would Make Them Cancel/Downgrade:**
- If Capital One shuts down the shopping portal or drastically reduces offer values
- If miles are devalued (worse than 1cpp on travel eraser)
- If the portal tracking issues become persistent and unresolvable

**How They Evaluate Annual Fee vs Value:**
- $395 - $300 credit - $100 (10K miles) = effectively free
- Portal deals alone have earned him 50K+ bonus miles in a year
- Even at 1cpp, that is $500+ in free value on top of the near-zero AF

---

## Spending & Payment Behavior

**Categories They Optimize For:**
- Shopping portal purchases (timing buys around high-multiplier offers)
- DoorDash/delivery (41x offer was a windfall)
- Groceries (SavorOne for 3x)
- Subscriptions (signs up for trials that offer 2,000-20,000+ bonus miles)

**Payment Habits:** Pays in full monthly; very intentional about when and where he spends
**How They Track/Redeem Rewards:**
- Built a Chrome extension (Capital One Offers Sorter) to sort offers by value
- Exports offers to CSV for analysis
- Monitors r/Venturex daily for new deals and data points
- Maintains a spreadsheet of all portal offers redeemed and tracking status

---

## Current Sentiment
